# On-chain CV front-end app

## About

This is a front-end app to view and manage personal CV information stored in blockchain using my
[On-chain CV smart contract](https://github.com/asolovov/cryptoCV). Be sure to check it, I have a
really good readme file there.
You can see Vercel deployed version [here](https://asolovov-crypto-cv.vercel.app/).

This repository is created to provide information about my front-end prototyping performance leven
to potential employer.

All the web3 logic code is stored in [helpers](https://github.com/asolovov/cryptocv-front/tree/main/helpers) directory.
